# Exercise: todo
In this exercise you will implement a "todo" React application, comprised of components with styling for displaying a form (to create new todos) and rendering a list of todos and their details.

## Part 1: Styling
In this part of the exercise, a couple of components are to be created with proper styling applied.

### TodoForm
The _TodoForm_ component (in `TodoForm.tsx`) allows the user to enter a title and create a new todo.

__Inline styling__ is to be used, with the following CSS properties:

```javascript
{
  width: '100%',
  backgroundColor: '#FFF',
  padding: 16,
  fontSize: 24,
  fontStyle: 'italic',
  fontWeight: 300,
  border: 'none'
}
```

The component's markup:

```html
<form>
  <input
    placeholder="What do you need to do?"
  />
</form>
```

Apply the styling to the _input_ element.

(Render _TodoForm_ in _App_)

### Todo
The _Todo_ component (in `Todo.tsx`) renders a todo object.

> See `todos.json` for the structure of a todo object.

Import styled-components:

```javascript
import styled from 'styled-components';
```

_Todo_ accepts the following (required) props:

*   id: `number`
*   title: `string`
*   completed: `boolean`

> Hint: For props typing, use the `TodoType` from `types.ts`.

It returns the following markup:

```html
<Container>
  <div>
    <Checkbox
      id={`${id}`}
      type="checkbox"
    />
    <Label
      htmlFor={`${id}`}
    >
      Todo title goes here...
    </Label>
  </div>
  <Button />
</Container>
```

Notice that the markup seemingly contains other React components; these are so-called _styled components_, which render just as regular components.

Create the following styled components:

*   _Container_: a `div` styled with:

    ```css
    padding: 8px 16px;
    background-color: white;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
    align-items: center;
    margin: 5px 0;
    ```

*   _Checkbox_: an `input` styled with:

    ```css
    appearance: none;
    ```

*   _Label_: a `label` styled with:

    ```css
    background-position: center left;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    padding: 15px 15px 15px 60px;
    display: inline-block;
    ```

    In addition, add the CSS properties below; their values should adapt based on the `completed` prop passed to _Todo_:

    ```css
    background-image: url(/* checked if completed, otherwise unchecked; see Todo.snippet */);
    color: /* '#d9d9d9' if completed, otherwise 'initial' */;
    text-decoration: /* 'line-through' if completed, otherwise 'none' */
    ```

    > See [Adapting based on props](https://styled-components.com/docs/basics#adapting-based-on-props) in the styled-components documentation.

    The _Label_ styled component must be typed with any prop(s) it receives. 
    
    To add props typing for a typical styled component:

    ```javascript
    const MyStyledDiv = styled.div<{
      // myStringProp: string;
    }>`
      /* CSS properties... */
    `
    ```

*   _Button_: a `button` styled with:

    ```css
    font-size: 22px;
    color: #cc9a9a;
    
    &:after {
      content: /* value passed as a prop, e.g. 'x', goes here */;
    }
    
    &:hover {
      color: #af5b5e;
    }
    ```

    > Note: The _Button_ styled component, just like _Label_, will also have props typing.

Render the list of todos (`initialTodos` in _App_) below _TodoForm_. 

### Optional
Currently, the todo title is passed via `title` prop to _Todo_.

Another way to pass the title to _Todo_ is as follows:

```javascript
<Todo 
  key={todo.id}>
  {...todo}
>
  {todo.title}
</Todo>
```

I.e., the todo title is passed as "content" to _Todo_ and represented within the component via a `children` prop. This prop implicitly gets created with whatever is passed to a component as "content".

_Todo_ would now look as follows:

```javascript
const Todo = ({ id, completed, children }: TodoProps) => {
  // the todo title is now contained in the 'children' prop.
}
```

Remove the `title: string` prop and add a `children`: prop (of type `React.ReactNode`); ensure that the todo title is displayed.

__Bonus__: Instead of adding an explicit `children` prop to `TodoProps`, you may utilize the generic `React.PropsWithChildren` type instead, which implicitly includes the `children` prop:

```javascript
type TodoProps = PropsWithChildren<{
  // Todo props...
}>
```
### Extra: glitz
A library called [glitz](https://github.com/frenic/glitz) is used within Avensia for styling components (very similar to the styled-components library).

Peruse glitz and determine what changes would be required to migrate from styled-components and accomplish the same styling. 

## Part 2: Component state and event handling
In this part, the list of todos will be managed as component state (in _App_).

### Creating a todo
In order to create a todo with a user-entered title, the following must be implemented:

*   Add a `handleSubmit` event handler that is bound to the `onSubmit` form event.

    > To prevent default form submission, call `event.preventDefault()`; ensure that the event handler is properly typed.

    Verify that the event handler is called upon submitting the form (pressing Enter) by logging the title.

*   In order to support rerendering the application when a new todo is added, the list of todos must be managed as component state in _App_.

    Ensure that todos are now handled by the `useState` hook (passing the `initialTodos` as initial state), and that the hook's typing matches (an array of `TodoType`). 

    > Note: You'll now render the list of todos managed by `useState` instead of the previous `initialTodos`!

*   Create a callback function `createTodo` in the _App_ component:

    ```javascript
    const createTodo = (title: string) => {
      // update the state (= list of todos) by adding a new todo object - with the passed title - first in the list:
      const newTodo = {
        id: Date.now(),
        completed: false,
        title
      };
      //
      // Important! You must update the state (= list of todos) as a completely NEW list of todos, containing the new todo object as the first element followed by all the elements of the current todos list.
      //
      // Hint: Use the spread - ... - operator!
    }
    ```

    > See [this link](https://www.samanthaming.com/tidbits/14-combine-multiple-arrays-using-spread/) for how to create/combine arrays using the spread operator.
    
    Pass the `createTodo` callback function as a prop to _TodoForm_.

    Add props typing to _TodoForm_; the callback prop has the following type: `(title: string) => void`.

    Invoke the callback function upon form submission; verify that a new todo is added (first) to the list.

### Deleting a todo

*   Create a callback function `deleteTodo` in the _App_ component.

    This function should receive a todo id, remove the corresponding todo object and update the list of todos.

    > Hint: Use [array.filter()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter) to remove a todo and get a new list as a result.

*   Pass this function as a prop to the _Todo_ component (and update the component's props typing).

    > Hint: "Extend" `TodoType` by __intersecting__ it with the type `{ deleteTodo: (todoId: number) => void }`.

*   Bind an event handler function to the `onClick` event on the _Button_ styled component; the event handler should invoke
    the `deleteTodo` callback with the todo's id.

### Optional: Update a todo

*   Create a callback function `updateTodo` in the _App_ component.

    This function should receive a todo id, locate the corresponding todo object and flip the `completed` flag of that todo.

    > Hint: Use [array.map()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) to iterate over the todos, update the target todo object and get a new list as a result.

*   Pass this function as a prop to the _Todo_ component (and update the component's props typing).

*   Bind an event handler function to the `onClick` event on the _Checkbox_ styled component; the event handler should 
    invoke the `updateTodo` callback with the todo's id.

### Optional: Set document title
As the user interacts with the list of todos, the number of uncompleted todos should be displayed in the document title.

It's best practice to perform this type of calculation - a typical _side effect_ - in a `useEffect` callback, meaning the code will run __after__ the component has rendered . See the first code snippet [explaining effects in the React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html#effect-hook) for how the hook `useEffect` may be utilized.

Add a call to `useEffect` to the _App_ component that updates `document.title` with the number of uncompleted todos.

> Hint: Try to use `array.reduce()` to calculate the uncompleted count!

## Part 3: Data fetching
Instead of embedding static (mock) todos as part of the application bundle, the _App_ component should fetch todos from a remote API.

*   To differentiate between whether todos have been fetched or not, change the `useState` hook call for the todos to:

    ```javascript
    const [todos, setTodos] = useState<TodoType[] | undefined>()
    ```

    __Question__: Why is this better than simply having an empty array as the initial value?

*   Update the `useEffect` for setting the document title - if no todos are yet available, display `Todos (N/A)`.

*   Adjust the `createTodo`, `deleteTodo` and `updateTodo` functions to handle a possibly undefined array of todos.

    __Hints__
    
    *   To spread a potentially undefined array, use `...(array ?? [])` (?? is the _nullish coalescing operator_).

    *   To call a method on a potentially undefined array, use `array?.method()` (? allows for _optional chaining_).

*   If the todos have not yet been fetched, _only_ display `Loading todos...` as the render output.

*   Finally, add the following code to a `useEffect` callback:

    ```javascript
    const fetchTodos = async () => {
      const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos');
      const todos = await response.json();

      setTodos(todos.map(
        ({ userId, ...todo }: ({ userId: number } & TodoType)) => todo
      ));
    };

    fetchTodos();
    ```

    __Important__: Ensure that the todos are only fetched once!

### Optional: Fetching status 
Fetching data typically involves a number of stages:

*   `idle`

    Data fetching has not yet begun.

*   `loading`

    Data fetching has begun.

*   `success`

    Data was fetched successfully.

*   `failure`

    An error occurred while fetching data.

    __Hint__: To simulate a fetching error, change the URL to something invalid.

A better way to differentiate whether or not data has been fetched, as well as to handle any errors, is to introduce state in the component which tracks these data fetching stages.

*   Create a new type which is the union of the above stages.

*   Add a state variable (suitably called _status_) with `useState` that is parameterized by the new type. Let the initial state be a status of `idle`.

*   Add error handling to the data fetching code as follows:

    ```javascript
    try {
      const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos');
      const todos = await response.json();

      setTodos(todos.map(
        ({ userId, ...todo }: ({ userId: number } & TodoType)) => todo
      ));
    } catch (error) {
      
    }
    ```

    In the code above, update the status where appropriate to reflect the various data fetching stages.

*   If the status is `idle`, return null as the render output.

*   If the status is `loading`, return `Loading todos...` as the render output.

*   If the status is `failure`, return a button "Retry" as the render output. When clicked, it should refetch the data.

    __Hints__

    *   In order for data fetching to be retried, the `useEffect` must add the status state variable as a dependency. 

        Inside the `useEffect` callback, first check if the status is `idle`; if it's not, return immediately.

    *   Set the status to the appropriate value when clicking the "Retry" button.
